## üí° Comments and Notes

### Technical Decisions
- **React with Hooks**: Used functional components with hooks for modern React development
- **Local Storage**: Chosen for simplicity and offline functionality, though not suitable for production
- **CSS-in-CSS**: Used traditional CSS for styling to maintain separation of concerns
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with CSS media queries

### Known Limitations
- **Data Persistence**: Data is stored locally and will be lost if browser data is cleared
- **No Backend**: Currently a client-side only application
- **Limited Validation**: Basic form validation, could be more comprehensive
- **No Real-time Updates**: Data doesn't sync across multiple browser tabs/devices

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Requires JavaScript enabled
- Local storage support required

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient re-rendering with React hooks
- Responsive design optimized for mobile devices
- Minimal external dependencies for faster loading
